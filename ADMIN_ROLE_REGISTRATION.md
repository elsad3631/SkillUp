# Automatic Admin Role Assignment During Registration

## Overview
This implementation ensures that all users who register through the system automatically receive the 'admin' role, giving them administrative privileges.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Service (`azure_functions_backend/src/services/auth.service.ts`)
- **Default Role Change**: Changed the default role from `['employee']` to `['admin']` in the registration function
- **Role System Integration**: Added automatic assignment of the admin role through the role-permission system
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks to ensure registration doesn't fail if role assignment fails
- **Logging**: Added console logs to track successful role assignments and warnings for missing roles

### 2. CV Data Service (`azure_functions_backend/src/services/cvdata.services.ts`)
- **Default Role Change**: Updated the default role from `['employee']` to `['admin']` for users created from CV uploads
- **Role System Integration**: Added automatic admin role assignment for users created through CV processing
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensures all user creation methods assign admin role

## Implementation Details

### Role Assignment Process
1. User registers through `/api/auth/register` endpoint
2. User is created with `roles: ['admin']` in the database
3. System automatically assigns the admin role through the `UserRole` table
4. Role assignment is logged for debugging purposes

### Error Handling
- If the admin role doesn't exist in the database, a warning is logged but registration continues
- If role assignment fails, an error is logged but the user is still created
- Registration process is not interrupted by role assignment issues

### Database Schema
The implementation uses both:
- **Simple roles array**: `roles: ['admin']` in the `ApplicationUser` table
- **Complex role system**: `UserRole` and `RolePermission` tables for granular permissions

## Testing
To test the implementation:

1. Register a new user through the signup form
2. Check that the user has admin privileges
3. Verify in the database that:
   - `ApplicationUser.roles` contains `['admin']`
   - `UserRole` table has an entry linking the user to the admin role

## Security Considerations
- All newly registered users will have admin privileges
- Consider implementing additional verification steps if needed
- The system maintains audit logs of role assignments

## Rollback
If you need to revert to the previous behavior:
1. Change `roles = ['admin']` back to `roles = ['employee']` in both services
2. Remove the automatic role assignment code blocks
3. Update any frontend components that depend on the new behavior
